## Introduction
This is what will eventually become **Rune Emacs** (or maybe some other spelling). For now, it's 
basically just a config file. I'm...actually a little unclear on what the license is even 
for...it might not even have a purpose. In any case, it has one thing going for it at the moment: 
a very easy "installation" process. 

This is essentially meant to be an absolute noob's version of Emacs. Specifically, someone who 
most likely:
* Has used Vim in the past and got used to the keybindings
* Wants to avoid "Emacs pinky" for paranoid reasons
* Has tried Emacs and already misses sane finger movement

### Prerequisites
The only real requirement is [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Other than that, 
you really don't need anything else. Remember, this is meant to be Emacs for someone who really 
doesn't know how to get started. At least at this point. There really isn't much going on under 
the hood right now, since that would defeat the purpose somewhat. 

To install Emacs, you should use whatever package manager your distribution uses and install
it through the command line. For example:

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt install emacs
```

#### Fedora
```sh
sudo dnf install emacs
```

#### Arch Linux
```sh
sudo pacman -Syu emacs
```

### Installation
(Full discolure: if you're reading this, I haven't actually *tested* this out yet. I'll get 
to it tomorrow. Probably.)

The easiest way to install this is to simply use the script included in this GitHub repo. You 
can download it yourself by clicking on the ```sh install.sh ```
