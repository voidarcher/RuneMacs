## Introduction
This is what will eventually become **RuneMacs** or maybe some other spelling. For now, it's 
basically just a config file. I'm...actually a little unclear on what the license is even 
for...it might not even have a purpose. In any case, it has one thing going for it at the moment: 
a very easy "installation" process. 

This is essentially meant to be an absolute noob's version of Emacs. Specifically, someone who 
most likely:
1) Has used Vim in the past and got used to the keybindings 
2) Wants to avoid "Emacs pinky" for hypochondriac reasons
3) You've tried Emacs and already miss sane finger movement

### Prerequisites
The only real requirement is 
[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Other than that, 

### Installation
(Full discolure: if you're reading this, I haven't actually *tested* this out yet. I'll get 
to it tomorrow. Probably.)

You're going to need someplace to build this thing. Personally, I'm partial to having a 
~/tmp directory in my home folder to do random stuff in before wiping. Make an empty ~/tmp 
directory. 

```sh
mkdir tmp
cd tmp/
```
After that, you'll want to clone this github repo into your empty ~/tmp directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/voidarcher/RuneMacs.git ~/tmp
```
