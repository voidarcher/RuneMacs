## Introduction
This is what will eventually become RuneMacs (pronounced "roon eemacks"). For now, it's basically
just a config file. I'm...actually a little unclear on what the license is even for...it might
not even have a purpose. In any case, it has one thing going for it at the moment: a very easy
"installation" process.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* Emacs (only tested on 28.2+)
* That's...pretty much it. As is part of the point of this

### Install Process
Personally, I'm partial to having a /tmp directory in my home folder.
